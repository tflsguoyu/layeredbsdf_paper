		\textbf{Example paths} of lengths 1, 2 and 3.
		In our formulation, the exact positions of the vertices do not matter: the $z_i$ only carry information about which interface the vertex occurs on.
		The first and last in the sequence of directions $\bd_i$ map to the incoming and outgoing directions of the underlying BSDF query.
