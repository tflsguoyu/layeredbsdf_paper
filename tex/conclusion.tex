\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we introduced a new BSDF model to capture the appearance of layered materials. Inside the evaluation and sampling routines of the layered BSDF, we run a Monte Carlo simulation of light transport within flat slabs. This is substantially faster than explicitly constructing the layer geometry, but also allows constructing light transport paths that would not easily be available to a generic light transport algorithm, due to our new position-free path formulation.

Within this framework, we introduced unbiased Monte Carlo techniques analogous to a forward path tracer with next event estimation (NEE) and a fully bidirectional estimator. We demonstrated the capabilities of our solution on a number of examples, featuring multiple layers with surface and volumetric scattering, surface and phase function anisotropy, and spatial variation in all parameters. This leads to the first BSDF layering solution that offers unbiased accuracy and full flexibility in setting the layer properties.
